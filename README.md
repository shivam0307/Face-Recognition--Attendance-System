# Face-Recognition-Attendance-System
Application of Deep Neural Networks ( CNN Based dlib and OpenCV modules ) in recognizing Faces with high accuracy and marking Attendance.

Have you noticed that Facebook has developed an uncanny ability to recognize your friends in your photographs? In the old days, Facebook used to make you to tag your friends in photos by clicking on them and typing in their name. Now as soon as you upload a photo, Facebook tags everyone for you like magic:
This technology is called face recognition. Facebook’s algorithms are able to recognize your friends’ faces after they have been tagged only a few times.

This technology is called face recognition. Facebook’s algorithms are able to recognize your friends’ faces after they have been tagged only a few times. It’s pretty amazing technology — Facebook can recognize faces with 98% accuracy which is pretty much as good as humans can do!

## What is Face Recognition?
Face recognition is the task of identifying an already detected object as a known or unknown face. Often the problem of face recognition is confused with the problem of face detection. Face Recognition on the other hand is to decide if the "face" is someone known, or unknown, using for this purpose a database of faces in order to validate this input face.

But Before all these, we should have basic understnding of Machine Learning & Deep Learning Concepts!

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed. ML is one of the most exciting technologies that one would have ever come across. As it is evident from the name, it gives the computer that makes it more similar to humans: The ability to learn. Machine learning is actively being used today, perhaps in many more places than one would expect.

**Supervised learning** is when the model is getting trained on a labelled dataset. A labelled dataset is one that has both input and output parameters. In this type of learning both training and validation, datasets are labelled.

**Unsupervised learning** is the training of a machine using information that is neither classified nor labeled and allowing the algorithm to act on that information without guidance. Here the task of the machine is to group unsorted information according to similarities, patterns, and differences without any prior training of data.

 ## An Introduction with Deep Neural Networks
 
Neural networks are the core of deep learning, a field that has practical applications in many different areas. Today neural networks are used for image classification, speech recognition, object detection, etc.
Deep structured learning or hierarchical learning or deep learning in short is part of the family of machine learning methods which are themselves a subset of the broader field of Artificial Intelligence.

**Deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms that use several layers of nonlinear processing units for feature extraction and transformation. Each successive layer uses the output from the previous layer as input.**
Deep neural networks, deep belief networks and recurrent neural networks have been applied to fields such as computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, audio recognition, social network filtering, machine translation, and bioinformatics where they produced results comparable to and in some cases better than human experts have.
