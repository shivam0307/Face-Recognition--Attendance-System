Application of Deep Neural Networks ( CNN Based dlib and OpenCV modules ) in recognizing Faces with high accuracy and marking Attendance.

Have you noticed that Facebook has developed an uncanny ability to recognize your friends in your photographs? In the old days, Facebook used to make you to tag your friends in photos by clicking on them and typing in their name. Now as soon as you upload a photo, Facebook tags everyone for you like magic:
This technology is called face recognition. Facebook’s algorithms are able to recognize your friends’ faces after they have been tagged only a few times.

## What is Face Recognition?
Face recognition is the task of identifying an already detected object as a known or unknown face. Often the problem of face recognition is confused with the problem of face detection. Face Recognition on the other hand is to decide if the "face" is someone known, or unknown, using for this purpose a database of faces in order to validate this input face.
